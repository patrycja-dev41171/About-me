👋 Hello dear friend!

My name is Patrycja and I'm a novice web developer. My programming adventure started in June 2021. Since then, I have learned: 

- HTML ⭐⭐⭐
- CSS ⭐⭐⭐ 
- JS ⭐⭐⭐
- Node.js ⭐⭐ 
- Express.js ⭐⭐

🔵 English - B2

I constantly expand my knowledge and practice my skills. In March, I finished my engineering studies in the field of Business Informatics and I am open to participation in an internship or the first job offer.

🌱 I’m currently learning React.js, TypeScript, databases ( the basics of: MongoDB, MySQL, HeidiSQL ).

About me:
I am an introvert who likes to have an opinion sometimes. I'm interested in many different things. I like going to concerts and festivals 🎶, traveling is also no stranger to me 🗺️. I usually watch sports on TV, especially tennis in the middle of the night 🎾. But I always combine my interests with work and study. I like to have a balance in my life 🧘‍♀️.
