👋 Hello dear friend!

I’m @patrycja-dev41171 and I'm a novice web developer. My programming adventure started in June 2021. Since then, I have learned: 

- HTML ⭐⭐⭐, 
- CSS ⭐⭐⭐, 
- JS ⭐⭐⭐, 
- Node.js ⭐⭐, 
- Express.js ⭐⭐.

I am constantly deepening my knowledge and practicing my skills. In March I will finish my engineering studies in Business Informatics and I will be open to internship or first job offers.

🌱 I’m currently learning React.js, TypeScript, database ( the basics of: MongoDB, MySQL, HeidiSQL ).
